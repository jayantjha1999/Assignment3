a)Use Semantic HTML:
Semantic HTML elements provide meaning and structure to the content, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret.
Use appropriate HTML tags such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <figure>, and <figcaption> to semantically structure your content.

b)Provide Alternative Text for Images:
Always include descriptive alternative text for images using the alt attribute. This is crucial for users who are visually impaired and rely on screen readers to understand the content. 
The alternative text should convey the purpose or content of the image.

c)Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:

is essential for individuals who cannot use a mouse or other pointing devices.Test your website's navigation and functionality using only the keyboard to 
ensure a seamless experience.
